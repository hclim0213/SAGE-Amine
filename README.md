# What is SAGE-Amine?
----------------
**Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration for Amine (SAGE-Amine)** is an advanced extension of [Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration](https://github.com/hclim0213/SAGE/tree/main), specifically tailored for Amine.
It employs natural language processing techniques, including LSTM, Transformer, Transformer Decoder, and modified Transformer Decoder (X-Transformer Decoder), to generate Amines. 
These generated amines are then evaluated using multiple QSPR models to assess key physicochemical properties relevant to CO2 absorption.
